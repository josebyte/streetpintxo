# StreetPintxo

Street pintxo is born to help bars to survive the pandemic by promoting
serving pintxos on the street. Bars adhered to the program will offer a
discount to the clients in exchange of being promoted in our website.

This is an ambitious project so we will offer this service per city, and we
expect people from different countries to come and live this unique
experience.
